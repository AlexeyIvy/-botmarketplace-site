## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `POST /api/v1/lab/preview` — synchronous DSL dry-run against the last
  N hours (≤168) of `MarketCandle` data. Reuses the pure `runBacktest()`
  engine; no DB writes, no exchange call. Returns the same report shape
  as `/lab/backtest` plus a `meta` block with `candleCount`, `fromTsMs`,
  `toTsMs`, and `dataAgeMs` so callers can surface data-freshness lag.
  Rate-limited to 5 req/min per IP. (§5.12)
- `deploy/rollback.sh` with auto-detected previous tag, `--dry-run`,
  `--to`, `--yes`; warns on forward-only DB migrations. RUNBOOK §3.5.
  (§5.1, #277)
- Startup `validateBybitEnv()` — logs `[BYBIT MODE: LIVE|DEMO]` and refuses
  to start in `NODE_ENV=production` + `BYBIT_ENV=live` unless
  `BYBIT_ALLOW_LIVE=true`. (§5.10, #276)
- Periodic reconciler (`lib/periodicReconciler.ts`): stale-PENDING sweep
  cancels PENDING intents older than 10m in RUNNING runs; orphan-lease
  reclaim transfers leases from dead workers to the live one. New
  counters `botmarket_stale_pending_cancelled_total` +
  `botmarket_orphan_leases_reclaimed_total`. (§4.5.2, §4.5.3, #274, #275)
- `/readyz` health probe with systemd timer + Telegram/Slack webhook
  alerts on 2 consecutive failures. `deploy/healthcheck.sh` + new
  RUNBOOK §10 "Мониторинг и алерты". (Action 3, #272)
- Optional Sentry integration via `SENTRY_DSN` — no-op when unset; 5xx
  errors emit `captureException` with `reqId` context. (Action 3, #271)
- Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint with `prom-client` — default process
  metrics, intent counters, and HTTP request-duration histogram.
  nginx restricts external access to loopback. (Action 3, #270)
- GitHub Actions CI (typecheck + test:api + check:stray) and Dependabot
  weekly security updates. (Action 2, #257)
- Production readiness audit `docs/37-production-readiness-audit.md` —
  11-axis review + prioritised action plan. (#255)

### Changed

- CSP is now split between nginx (web pages) and API (JSON responses).
  nginx no longer adds CSP on `/api/*`; the API's strict
  `default-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'` is the single source of
  truth for JSON. (§5.8, #279)
- `stopWorker()` now releases `leaseUntil` on graceful shutdown so a
  restarting worker can claim immediately instead of waiting the 30s
  natural expiration window. (§4.5.1, #273)
- `DATABASE_URL` in `.env.example` now includes explicit
  `connection_limit=10` + `pool_timeout=10`. RUNBOOK §2 documents the
  sizing tradeoffs against Postgres `max_connections`. (§5.3, #278)

### Security

- Closed 12 prod-dep vulnerabilities (2 CRITICAL + 4 HIGH + 6 MODERATE)
  via `fastify ^5.8.4`, `next ^15.5.15`, and pnpm.overrides for
  `fast-jwt` / `defu`. (Action 1, #256)

### Docs

- RUNBOOK additions: §3.5 rollback procedure, §10 observability + alerts,
  §2 Prisma pool config + new env vars (`POOL_WAIT_THRESHOLD`,
  `BYBIT_ALLOW_LIVE`).
